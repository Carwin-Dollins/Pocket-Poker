# Pocket-Poker
Group 40.
This project involves the team creating a poker game that 
collects data on winning hands and process that collected 
data to create a report for players to see previous game 
data and improve their gameplay for future games. There 
are multiple portions of the project that were built: a 
front-end web app, the poker game built using Unity, 
back-end app, a database, and an analysis engine. Users 
should be able to play a virtual poker game using 
simulated money to enhance their skills
